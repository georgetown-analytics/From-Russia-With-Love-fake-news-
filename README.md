# From-Russia-With-Love-fake-news-
Cohort 22 Capstone Project for the Certificate of Data Science at Georgetown University School of Continuing Studies.

## Datasets

This project uses the Fake News Corpus Dataset, which is found [here.](https://github.com/several27/FakeNewsCorpus)

The original dataset is very large, and may not be easy for some systems to handle. To help with this problem, we have provided the reduced dataset create in this project [here.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jbj3gJIhAokFbh2qmXMHT62FiAVxTWeu?usp=sharing)

## Directories
